This is a simple implementation of a multiplayer number guessing game using socket.io. The game consists of two players who will try to guess a number between 1 and 100 generated by the server. The player who guesses closest to the number wins the game.

The server-side code is written in Node.js using the Express and Socket.io libraries. The server generates a random number when two players have connected and sends it to the clients. When a player makes a guess, the server stores the guess and waits for the other player to make a guess as well. Once both players have made a guess, the server calculates the closest guess and sends the result to the clients. If no player guessed the number, the game ends in a draw.

The client-side code is written in vanilla JavaScript and uses the socket.io client library to communicate with the server. When a player connects to the server, the server sends a player number to the client, which is displayed on the screen. If the player is the first to connect, they will see a message telling them to wait for another player to join. Once two players have connected, the game starts, and the client displays a message telling the player to guess a number between 1 and 100. The client-side code also handles sending the player's guess to the server and disabling the guess input field once the player has made a guess. Once the game is over, the client displays a message telling the player who won or if the game ended in a draw.
